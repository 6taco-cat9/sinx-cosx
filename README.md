# sinx-cosx
integration of sin^m x cos^n x

we know that ∫sin^m x cos^m x dx = ∫sin^m (2x) dx / 2^m => let this be formula 1
we know that ∫sin^m x cos^n x dx = ∫sin^m x cos^n-2 x dx - ∫sin^m+2 x cos^n-2 x dx => let this be formula 2
we know sin and cos are complementary so replacing x with π/2 - x can swap m and n => let this be formula 3

Can we create an infinite grid of m,n using these formulae?
